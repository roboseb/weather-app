    Webpack dev server is awesome. I learnt this when I got it working for the first time. However, it took me like three hours to get working. For the next few projects/assignments, I dreaded returning to it cause I didn't really understand it, despite the convenience it brings when you get it working.

    I am happy to say that I still don't understand how most of it works, but it only took me like 30 minutes to set up from scratch, with all the bells and whistles. Regardless of how the start of this weather app goes, today was a productive day. Finished my hearthstone non-API, read about async/await which seems much more straightforward and useful now, set up webpack and also cleaned my room. And did my laundry. Great day. Thanks rockstar energy.

    This weather app will be simple, but handsome. That is my plan. Since I went overboard with the last API thing, I should be able to get this weather app set up faster than I could have otherwise.
